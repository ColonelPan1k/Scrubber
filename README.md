# Scrubber

Scrubber (in it's finality) is a tool that will help you remove unsightly comments from source code.  

This includes benign things like `TODO` comments, reminders, notes, to more "sinister" ones like expletive-laden comments you might've left 
after trying to get something particulary stubborn to work.  It can also help in removing excessive comments or ones that might be obsolete.
